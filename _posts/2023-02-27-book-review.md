# Why is it important to read about data ethics or algorithmic bias? 

When we were assigned to read a book and write a review, I was not particularly thrilled with the idea, but through some research into these two fields, I understood the reasoning behind this assignment. When we handle data, we have a lot of power in the palm of our hands, learning about the dangers and the best ways to manage our tasks responsibly. Doing so will allow us to be ethical data scientists.

## The Atlas of AI: Power Politics and the Planetary Costs of AI by Kate Crawford

I chose this book mainly because I was attracted to the title and because I liked that it had a female author. In the following sections, I will go through an introduction of the book, its positive and negative highlights, what type of reader this book is better aimed for, and will give it a rating. 

### Intro 

The book is divided into three sections: The Labor of AI, the Planet of AI, and the Geopolitics of AI. It is referred to as an atlas because it is a combination of topics. The book includes politics and history and contains personal anecdotes that help explain the author's main ideas. 

### Positive Highlights 

The book does an excellent job of keeping the reader engaged. One of the strongest suits of the book is its organization. The sections tell you what they will discuss and do an excellent job staying on topic. Also, for each of these, she introduced the historical aspects before relating them back to AI. I liked how she kept only some of the history sequestered in the United States. It makes it more relatable to anyone that might read the book regardless of nationality. My favorite part of the book is how it puts things into perspective. For example, I just learned the environmental toll technology has all the minerals needed to produce the batteries in our daily computers. I was also surprised to learn that many AI algorithms may seem automatic but are human-made and might give biased results. I learned a lot of new information, but these were the main things I enjoyed about the book. 

### Negative Highlights 

As explained above, I enjoyed the book, so this section might be shorter than the previous one. One of the only big gripes I could find was how the author narrated personal anecdotes. Choosing to describe these in the first person POV instead of the third person POV took me out of the reading. I can understand the writing choice since it can make it more relatable to read it as if the story was happening to you, but it's not my cup of tea. The other thing I could criticize is the negative outlook on AI throughout the entire book. I know that the title of the book conveys that it will mainly talk about the issues with AI, but it could also be good to include more about how it benefits our society so people can see both sides of the conversation. 

### Is this book for you? 

As described in the two previous sections, the book combines topics from philosophy to politics. It does an excellent job of keeping the reader engaged, even if it could use a consistent perspective at the beginning of each section. However, the type of reader that would enjoy this book needs to like reading since the book is not short. Another thing is you need to enjoy history, or you will skip half the book if that's not the case. Finally, if fact-checking is your thing, you could read with a computer next to you and verify the integrity of the sources. In conclusion, the book appeals to a general audience but should be read by ages 12 and up.  

### Rating 

My rating for the book is 3.5/5. A good read that teaches you a lot about AI, but not necessarily one that I would read again.
