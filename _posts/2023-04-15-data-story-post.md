## Our Data So Far 

As a fan of movies, at the beginning of the project, I wanted to analyze what made a movie famous among a user database such as IMDb. The data was from their website and used for an exploratory data analysis to determine what categories impacted user scores. Was it the runtime? The rating? The critic's perception? Or the genre that had defined a movie's success? We also analyzed if there were patterns amongst the data, such as a particular actor or director and amount of votes. I made graphs with this information, which allowed me to draw valuable insights. If you want to take a look at how [I got the data](https://noryarroyo.github.io/my386blog/2023/03/16/data-collection.html) and the [EDA](https://noryarroyo.github.io/my386blog/2023/03/31/EDA-movies.html), you can check my last two blog posts. 


## The Data Story

The data story tells us that an action movie will likely enter the database. Although there are more votes for action movies, the drama category has the highest-rated movies overall. It is important to notice that the drama category usually blends in with other genres, which might explain why. These results make a lot of sense. Action movies are the big blockbusters that drive people to the movie theaters so that more people would watch them, therefore, get more votes. In addition, drama movies excel for their intricate plots, which could explain the high ratings. 

## Conclusion 

TThere is a lot more that could be done with this data, we could bring in the economic element, but so far, it's good to know that if a filmmaker wants to make a movie that leaves an impact on the general population, they can guide themselves on what drives that impact. As this data set updates over the years, I could find myself doing more stuff with it in the future, and I look forward to doing so in my Data Science career.
